Do not leave the victim unattended. 
Immediate medical attention is required. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
 
If inhaled 
: If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
Remove to fresh air. 
If breathing is irregular or stopped, administer artificial 
respiration. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: Immediate medical treatment is necessary as untreated 
wounds from corrosion of the skin heal slowly and with 
difficulty. 
Remove contaminated clothing and shoes. 
Wash contaminated clothing before re-use. 
Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes. 
If skin irritation persists, call a physician.
