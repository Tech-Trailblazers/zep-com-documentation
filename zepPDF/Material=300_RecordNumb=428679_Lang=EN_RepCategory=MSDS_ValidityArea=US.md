In case of skin contact 
: Immediate medical treatment is necessary as untreated 
wounds from corrosion of the skin heal slowly and with 
difficulty. 
Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes. 
If on clothes, remove clothes. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Small amounts splashed into eyes can cause irreversible 
tissue damage and blindness. 
Continue rinsing eyes during transport to hospital. 
Remove contact lenses. 
Protect unharmed eye. 
Keep eye wide open while rinsing. 
If eye irritation persists, consult a specialist. 
Immediately flush eyes for at least 15 minutes. Get medical 
attention. 
 
If swallowed 
: Keep respiratory tract clear. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
DO NOT induce vomiting unless directed to do so by a 
physician or poison control center. 
Take victim immediately to hospital. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Symptoms may include blistering, irritation, burns, and pain. 
Causes severe skin burns and eye damage. 
Suspected of causing cancer. 
Review section 2 of SDS to see all potential hazards. 
 
Notes to physician 
: Treat symptomatically.  Symptoms may be delayed.
