products 
:  Carbon dioxide (CO2) 
Carbon monoxide 
Smoke 
Chlorine compounds 
Specific extinguishing 
methods 
: Use extinguishing measures that are appropriate to local 
circumstances and the surrounding environment. 
 
Further information 
: Collect contaminated fire extinguishing water separately. This 
must not be discharged into drains.
