SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Consult a physician. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
 
If inhaled 
: If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: Immediate medical treatment is necessary as untreated 
wounds from corrosion of the skin heal slowly and with 
difficulty. 
Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes. 
If on clothes, remove clothes. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Small amounts splashed into eyes can cause irreversible

DO NOT induce vomiting unless directed to do so by a 
physician or poison control center. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Symptoms may include blistering, irritation, burns, and pain. 
Symptoms of overexposure may include disorientation; 
dizziness; and confusion.  May progress to unconsciousness, 
paralysis, and convulsions. 
 
Causes severe skin burns and eye damage.

Specific hazards during 
firefighting 
: Do not allow run-off from fire fighting to enter drains or water 
courses. 
 
 
Hazardous combustion 
products 
:  Carbon dioxide (CO2) 
Carbon monoxide 
Smoke
