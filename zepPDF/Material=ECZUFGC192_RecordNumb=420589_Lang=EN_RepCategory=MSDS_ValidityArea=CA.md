SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Do not leave the victim unattended. 
Move out of dangerous area. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
 
If inhaled 
: If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
Consult a physician after significant exposure. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: If skin irritation persists, call a physician. 
Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes. 
If on clothes, remove clothes. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Remove contact lenses. 
Protect unharmed eye. 
Keep eye wide open while rinsing. 
If eye irritation persists, consult a specialist. 
Rinse immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. 
 
If swallowed 
: Keep respiratory tract clear. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
DO NOT induce vomiting unless directed to do so by a 
physician or poison control center. 
Take victim immediately to hospital. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Overexposure may cause mild eye or skin irritation. 
Review section 2 of SDS to see all potential hazards. 
 
Notes to physician

SECTION 5. FIREFIGHTING MEASURES 
 
Suitable extinguishing media 
: Use water spray, alcohol-resistant foam, dry chemical or 
carbon dioxide. 
 
Unsuitable extinguishing 
media 
: High volume water jet 
 
 
Specific hazards during 
firefighting 
: Do not allow run-off from fire fighting to enter drains or water 
courses. 
 
 
Hazardous combustion 
products 
:  Carbon dioxide (CO2) 
Carbon monoxide 
Smoke 
Specific extinguishing 
methods 
: Use extinguishing measures that are appropriate to local 
circumstances and the surrounding environment. 
 
Further information 
: Standard procedure for chemical fires. 
Collect contaminated fire extinguishing water separately. This 
must not be discharged into drains. 
Fire residues and contaminated fire extinguishing water must 
be disposed of in accordance with local regulations. 
For safety reasons in case of fire, cans should be stored 
separately in closed containments. 
Use a water spray to cool fully closed containers. 
 
Special protective equipment 
for firefighters 
: Wear self-contained breathing apparatus for firefighting if 
necessary. 
 
 
SECTION 6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
 
Personal precautions, 
protective equipment and 
emergency procedures 
: Use personal protective equipment. 
Ensure adequate ventilation. 
Remove all sources of ignition. 
Evacuate personnel to safe areas. 
Beware of vapours accumulating to form explosive 
concentrations. Vapours can accumulate in low areas. 
 
Environmental precautions 
: Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. 
Prevent product from entering drains. 
If the product contaminates rivers and lakes or drains, inform 
respective authorities. 
 
Methods and materials for 
containment and cleaning up 
: Soak up with inert absorbent material (e.g. sand, silica gel, 
acid binder, universal binder, sawdust). 
Sweep up or vacuum up spillage and collect in suitable 
container for disposal. 
 
 
 
SECTION 7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
Advice on safe handling 
: Avoid exposure - obtain special instructions before use. 
Avoid contact with skin and eyes.
